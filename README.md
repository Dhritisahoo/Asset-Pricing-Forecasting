# Asset-Pricing-Forecasting
This repository contains several asset pricing forecasting techniques that have been implemented to increase familiarity with different concepts. The aim of these projects is to explore new concepts and run them on a simple dataset.

The following techniques have been implemented in this repository:

The carry trade strategy
The contrarian strategy 
The Kalman filter strategy 

Each project has been implemented in Python and has a separate folder containing all the necessary code and data files. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it an excellent resource for those new to the topic.

These projects can serve as a starting point for anyone looking to explore the different asset pricing forecasting techniques and their implementation. Feel free to use this repository as a reference or starting point for your own projects.
